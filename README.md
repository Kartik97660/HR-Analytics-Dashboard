# HR Analytics Dashboard – Attrition & Workforce Insights
# 1. Executive Summary

This project delivers a comprehensive HR Analytics dashboard designed to analyze employee attrition, workforce demographics, and job satisfaction across multiple organizational dimensions. Built using Tableau, the dashboard enables HR leaders and decision-makers to move from descriptive reporting to insight-driven action.

The solution consolidates key workforce indicators into a single, interactive view, allowing stakeholders to identify attrition hotspots, demographic risk segments, and role-specific satisfaction patterns.

# 2. Business Objective

The primary objective of this project is to support strategic workforce planning and retention management by answering the following business questions:

Where is employee attrition concentrated across departments?

Which age groups and genders are most vulnerable to attrition?

How does job satisfaction vary by role?

Does educational background correlate with higher attrition?

What is the current health of the workforce in terms of active employees and age distribution?

# 3. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

The dashboard tracks and summarizes the following core HR metrics:

Total Employee Count: 1,470

Attrition Count: 237

Attrition Rate: 16.12%

Active Employees: 1,233

Average Employee Age: 37

These KPIs provide immediate context for deeper analytical exploration.

# 4. Analytical Views & Insights
4.1 Department-wise Attrition

Identifies departments contributing disproportionately to overall attrition

Sales emerges as the largest contributor, while HR records minimal attrition

Enables prioritization of department-specific retention initiatives

4.2 Workforce Distribution by Age Group

Majority of employees fall within the 25–39 age range

Attrition risk peaks in early- to mid-career stages

Supports targeted engagement, learning, and career progression programs

4.3 Job Satisfaction Rating by Job Role

Compares satisfaction levels across distinct job roles

Highlights roles with large headcounts but inconsistent satisfaction levels

Provides evidence for role redesign, compensation review, or workload balancing

4.4 Education Field-wise Attrition

Attrition is highest among employees from Life Sciences and Medical backgrounds

Lower attrition observed in HR and niche education fields

Suggests potential gaps between role expectations and talent background

4.5 Attrition Rate by Gender and Age Group

Male attrition exceeds female attrition across most age segments

The 25–34 age group shows the highest attrition intensity

Useful for designing inclusive retention and benefit strategies
